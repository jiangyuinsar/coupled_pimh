# Coupled PIMH

Code to produce figures using in Unbiased Smoothing using Particle Independent Metropolisâ€“Hastings.
Three models provided - linear-Gaussian state space model, stochastic volatility and Markov jump process. It is recommended to begin by running 

'inst/reproduce/stochastic_kinetic/stochastic_kinetic_plot_state.R'

to gain unbiased estimates of smoothing distributions for the Markov jump process.
